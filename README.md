# GameBox
This is a game box with 3 simple "games" inside of it. You can play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer, you can have the computer guess the number you thought of, or check if a number is palindromic.

GameBox.java contains the main file, the others are "classes." This was a project for my Object-Oriented Programming course, where we were applying OO approach to problems, that were previously solved in an imperative approach.

To run this program, simply download the files in a new directory and run GameBox.java through a developer's coding environment like VS Code, or compile from terminal by typing "javac GameBox.java" and then run by typing "java GameBox"
